Enables a site administrator to log out a user remotely via the WordPress admin interface

== Description ==

Sometimes you need to log out all the users from your site (or a single user) and force them to re-login. This plugin adds a simple action link to the standard User admin page (and the network admin page) that will forcibly log out the user the next time they interact with your site.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin file and upload the directory to your wp-content/plugins directory or use the built in WordPress installer.
1. Go to the Plugins admin page and Activate the plugin, if you want the plugin activated network wide then network activate the plugin in the Network admin plugins page.
1. Once installed, you can force a user to login to your site again by clicking on the "Log Out" link under each user in the User admin pages of your WordPress site.
