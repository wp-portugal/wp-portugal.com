Don't you hate it when plugins add top level menus between "Dashboard" and "Posts"? This shoves those to the end.

== Description ==

Some plugins (I'm looking at you, Automattic) put top level nav menus in the first menu group, right under "Dashboard." This is annoying. These things are invariably less important than your posts, pages, comments, etc. This simple plugin (with no UI) shoves these line-cutting menus to the bottom, where they belong.

== Installation ==

1. It should just work when you activate it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin solve an annoying problem? =

Yes.

= What if my plugin lets the user choose where to put the menu? =

Then you should contact me so I can whitelist your menu item. Also, bless you, my child.
